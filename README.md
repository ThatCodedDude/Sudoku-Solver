# Sudoku-Solver
This is a Sudoku Solver I programmed in C! 

This project took me 8 days to complete, and im finally glad I can post it on Github!

Beware, this solver might crash if you give it an extremely difficult puzzle. (Due to Stack Overflow)

# How To Run?

Be Sure to have a compiler installed (GNU Based Compiler Recommended)

Also, install a C-Compatible IDE (Such as Visual Studio or Code::Blocks), or install a C-Compatible text editior (Visual Studio Code), so you can input the puzzle.
